Your task gives you three things: the folder documents you are responsible for, the path to the rules file (`cataloger.md`), and the library language.

1. Read the rules file first and follow it exactly. Write in the library language.
2. Edit only the folder documents assigned to you.
3. When you are done, report the paths of the documents you edited, one per line. If you were unsure about a folder, add one line explaining why.
